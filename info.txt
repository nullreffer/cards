So the idea would be there would be a deck of cards (if I am copying pit it would be 74 cards)  with 8 suits 

and they would be rare metals, implants, spice, water, bottlecaps, flurbo, resonator coils, slugs.

 There would be 9 cards of each suit.  
 
 The main mechanism is that you need all of one suit to win.
 
 You get dealt out 9 cards and the first person that gets all 9 of them to be one suit wins. 
 
 How you do that is autioning off the cards in your hands.
 
  You can't say what you are trading, but you can be like a number and you have to have that amount of matching cards in your hand to trade with someone for their matching cards.
  
  So you might get the ones you want and you might not.  but it is normally a very face paced game.
  
   It would be nice to have it be like these two cards from your hand you want to trade and select them and 
   you can even have it displayed the number people want to trade and a button to accept a trade.

   the person decides what they would like to trade from their hand
so pretty much if they have 3 of a type they can do that
